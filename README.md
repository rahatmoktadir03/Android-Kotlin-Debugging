# AND101 Project 2 - Kotlin Debug-a-thon

Submitted by: **Rahat Moktadir**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Bug Smasher** is an Android app that was riddled with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs. 
With those gone, it's now a smooth collection of helpful and fun widgets, including number sum, color generation, and daily date checkers. 
The project was focused on understanding Kotlin syntax and fixing key issues like `NullPointerException`, `ClassCastException`, and array indexing errors. 
It really sharpened my ability to debug under pressure and write safer, more idiomatic Kotlin code.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🐛🧠🔧

## Notes

Throughout this project, I gained a much deeper appreciation for Kotlin's null-safety system and the importance of type safety in Android development. 
Fixing crashes due to improper casting, unguarded recursion, and null misuse helped solidify some key best practices. 
Also, Kotlin's clean syntax for collections (like `joinToString`) is just *chef's kiss* 👨‍🍳.
